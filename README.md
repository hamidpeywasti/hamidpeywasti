# 👋 Hello, I'm Hamid Peywasti

I'm an experienced web developer from Tabriz, Iran, with over 10 years of hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development. I specialize in CMS development, custom plugin/bundle creation, and technical SEO.

In addition to my web development background, I have an academic and research background in both **Physics** and **Computer Engineering**, with published thesis-level work in **superconducting materials** and **deep learning for image classification**.
